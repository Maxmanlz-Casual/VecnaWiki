- We step into the portal and appear in the Underdark
- We appear to have manifested in a small room and it is very dark(fitting lol)
- Hidden entrance to web's edge
- We see 8 symbols carved in the doorway
	- We cannot understand it
	- we eventually manage to pick the lock
- We go into the room
	- to the north there is 2 rubys on the floor
	- both of them were trapped and were fake rubies
	- to the south there is a shrine with some gross stuff on it
- In front of the shrine there is a cultist of lolth and a goblin
