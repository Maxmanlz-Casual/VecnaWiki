## Finding Umbert
- South of the creatures there is a door, that leads to Umbert Noblin
- Kidnappers were wearing heavy black hoods
	- Also wearing red gloves
		- Possibly to imitate vecna's hands

	 - There has been a rythmic chanting the entire time we were approaching it
	 - There is an elf struggling in a cage dangling from the middle of the room
	 - it appears to be an auditorium type of stage room![[Pasted image 20240714213416.png]]
 - We have a vision of vecna cults taking secrets from people in a ritual and feeding it to vecna
	 - in the vision we saw vecna and his purple left eye 
 - As soon as we take down the cult leader, we go to sleep and then wake up inside of open coffins
