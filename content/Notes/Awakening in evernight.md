 - Eldon(the elf that was in the cage when we all fell asleep) has told us that we seem to have fallen into a crevice that seemed to have disappeared
	 - He called this crevice an unstable one
	 - We seem to be in an alternate version of neverwinter
	 - we need a stable crevice to be able to go back to neverwinter
	 - He suggests we go to a possible marketplace 
 - We spot a large goat headed creature roaming the graveyard
	 - We skedaddle before it can see us and we make our way to the market
	 - The market is bustling with swathes of undead creatures
		 - Vampire, zombie, etc
	 - We enter the market after donning some disguises
		 - We meet a merchant named sangora and ask her for directions to the material plane
	 - Dolindar's tomb a tomb that we should find
		 - In the graveyard we woke up in
	 - She told us that we shouldn't rest here
 - We make our way to this tomb 
	 - As we approach we cannot find the goatheaded creature
 - We make our way inside the tomb and there are a bunch of slabs
	 - On the slabs are carvings of robed humans
	 - There is a note on one of the slabs
 - The paper says Numy's room and as we are reading it a ghost pops out
	 - The ghost talks to us about the Dolindar's who hired her to clean the tomb
	 - Shes not sure how to open the next door room
